# Module 3 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Lab Introduction 

### MS-100T00 and MS-101T00 Virtual Lab Environments

The Enterprise Administrator Learning Path consists of two courses – MS-100T00 (Microsoft 365 Identity and Services) and MS-101T00 (Microsoft 365 Mobility and Security). The labs in each course require you to perform the lab steps in virtual lab environment.

The labs for each course are independent of one another; in other words, the labs for MS-101 do NOT continue from where the MS-100 labs left off. Each course offers its own unique lab scenario using completely different VM environments:

- **MS-100T00 - Microsoft 365 Identity and Services:** The labs in this course have been configured for a hybrid deployment at Adatum Corporation. Adatum is running both an on-premises deployment and using Microsoft 365 in the cloud. Therefore, the virtual machines for this course consist of a Domain Controller, a Client PC, and an on-premises Exchange Server VM, all networked together in the Adatum domain.

- **MS-101T00 - Microsoft 365 Mobility and Security:** In the lab scenario for is course, Adatum Corporation does not have an on-premises deployment and is instead managing their Microsoft 365 deployment strictly through Microsoft Azure. Since this is a cloud-only deployment, the VM environment for this course simply consists of two Client PCs.

The lab environments have been specifically designed in this manner to give you experience managing a Microsoft 365 deployment in both a hybrid environment and in a pure cloud environment. You may see some of the same user names across the labs (for example, Holly Dickson, Adatum&#39;s Global Administrator), but that will be the only similarity that you&#39;ll see between the labs for each course.

### MS-101 Lab Environment

The labs in this course will use two virtual machines:

- Client 1 VM (LON-CL1), a stand-alone client
- Client 2 VM (LON-CL2), a stand-alone client

**Important:** A local administrator account has been created on the client VMs. These will be the accounts that you use to log into each VM. As you will see on the desktop, you can log into each machine as either an admin or student account. All MS-101 lab exercises will use the admin account for login. The password of the admin account is **Pa55w.rd** (**Note**: the password for ALL user accounts in the MS-101 labs is **Pa55w.rd)**.

Since the MS-101 lab scenario involves a cloud-only deployment, you will not be logging into an on-premises domain, since no such domain exists. Following your login, the desktop will indicate that you are logged in as either **lon-cl1\admin** or **lon-cl2\admin**, depending on which machine you are on.

Your Office 365 tenant came with a default global administrator account already created in Microsoft 365. The name of this user account is **MOD Administrator**. The username for this MOD Administrator account is **admin@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com**, which is the username assigned to your tenant in the **O365 Credentials** window (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider). When you sign into Office 365 with this **admin@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** username, your user initials of **MA** (for **M** OD **A** dministrator) will display in a circle as the user icon in the upper right corner of the Office 365 screens.

When you initially log into Office 365, you will log in with this **MOD Administrator** account of **admin@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (with the password of **Pa55w.rd**). In Exercise 1 in this lab, you will then create a Microsoft 365 user account for Holly Dickson, who is Adatum&#39;s Enterprise Administrator. You will assign Holly the Microsoft 365 Global Admin role, and you will use the Holly Dickson persona to perform the majority of administrative tasks throughout the labs in this course.

### WARNING – Be prepared for UI changes

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you may experience user interface (UI) changes that were made following the development of this training content. This will manifest itself in UI changes that do not match up with the detailed instructions presented in this lab manual.

The Microsoft World-Wide Learning team will update this training course as soon as any such changes are brought to our attention. However, given the dynamic nature of cloud updates, you may run into UI changes before this training content is updated. **If this occurs, you will have to adapt to the changes and work through them in the lab exercises as needed.  **

### Introduction

This lab references one domain:

- **@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** - This is the domain associated with the Office 365 tenant that was provided by the lab hosting provider. The first part of this domain name (M365xZZZZZZ) is the unique tenant ID provided by the lab hosting provider. The ZZZZZZ portion of the tenant ID, which is the tenant suffix ID, will be unique for each student.

    **IMPORTANT:** This is critical because throughout this lab, you will be asked to enter the **M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** domain name when signing into apps with a given username (for example, holly@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com). When doing so, you must enter the unique tenant suffix ID that is assigned to your tenant ID in place of the ZZZZZZ.

    For example, if your Tenant Email is **admin@M365x609668.onmicrosoft.com**, the unique tenant suffix ID (ZZZZZZ) is **609668**. When logging in as Holly when entering this domain, you would replace ZZZZZZ with 609668 (for example, holly@M365a609668.onmicrosoft.com). When you come to an instruction that requires your domain suffix for the **onmicrosoft.com** domain, remember to replace the ZZZZZZ in the instruction with the tenant suffix ID provided by your lab hosting provider.   

**RECOMMENDATION:** It is highly recommended that you write down the values of the ZZZZZZ tenant ID, the XXYYZZ UPN Name, and the IP address, all of which are provided by your lab hosting provider. This will save you from having to constantly retrieve this information from your VM lab environment.

**IMPORTANT:** In this lab, you will be in the role of the Enterprise Administrator for Adatum Corporation. In the fictitious organizational structure that has been created for this lab, Contoso Ltd. is the parent company of Adatum Corporation, one of its subsidiaries. As such, the Office 365 tenant has been set up to reflect the Contoso name, which appears wherever the company name from the tenant is displayed in the Office 365 environment. The tenant letterhead can easily be changed by editing the Organizational Profile, which you will do in the first lab exercise by changing the tenant name from Contoso to Adatum.

### Use the new Microsoft 365 admin center

Throughout the lab exercises for this course, if you navigate to the Microsoft 365 admin center and are prompted with a windows asking if you want to try the new Microsoft 365 admin center, always select the **Try it now** button.

**IMPORTANT:** The instructions that are provided in the lab exercises for this course are based on the new Microsoft 365 admin center UI and not the classic UI.
