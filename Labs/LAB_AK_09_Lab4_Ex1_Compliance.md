# Module 9 - Lab 4 - Exercise 1 - Initialize Compliance 

In your role as Holly Dickson, Adatum’s Enterprise Administrator, you have Microsoft 365 deployed in a virtualized lab environment. As you proceed with your Microsoft 365 pilot project, your next steps are to implement archiving and retention at Adatum. You will begin by initializing compliance through the MDM auto-enrollment of new devices in your tenant. You will then configure retention tags and policies, and you will implement archiving with MRM retention tags. 

### Task 1 - Create a Group for Compliance Testing

To test archiving and retention in your Adatum pilot project, you will create a new mail-enabled security group and assign two users to the group – Joni Sherman and Lynne Robbins. These will be your two test users involved in the Windows Information Protection (WIP) pilot program. This group will then be used in the next task when you configure MDM auto-enrollment for new devices in your tenant. 

1. At the end of the prior lab, you were using the LON-CL2 VM. Switch to the LON-CL1 VM. You should still be logged into LON-CL1 as the **lon-cl1\admin** account, and you should be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Holly Dickson**. 

2. In **Microsoft Edge**, select the **Microsoft 365 admin center tab** or open a new tab and go to **https://admin.microsoft.com.** 

3. the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Groups** and then select **Groups** below it.

4. Select **Add a group** to create a new group for compliance testing. 

5. In the **Add a group** window, enter the following information:

6. Fill all the fields to create the **WIP Users** group:

	- Type: **Mail-enabled security**

	- Name **WIP Users**

	- Group email address: tab into this field and **wipusers** is automatically pre-filled for you as the alias of the group email address

	- Group email address domain: to the right of the group email address alias is the email address domain. **M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider) should be displayed here.

7. Select **Add**, and then select **Close**.

8. In the **Microsoft 365 admin center** tab, refresh the page to display the WIP users group in the list of Groups. You may have to wait a minute or two before you see the WIP users group.

9. Once **WIP Users** appears In the **Groups** window, select it.

10. In the **WIP Users** window, select the **Members** tab.

12. In the **View members** window, select **+Add members**. This displays the list of users.

13. In the list of users, select **Joni Sherman** and **Lynne Robbins**, then scroll to the bottom of the list and select **Save**, and then select **Close**.  <br/>

	‎**Note:** It may take a few minutes for both Joni and Lynne to display in the list of users. Simply refresh the list until both users appear.

14. Close the **WIP users** window.

15. Leave your browser open to the Microsoft 365 admin center and proceed to the next task.


### Task 2 – Configure Mobile Device Management Auto-enrollment

In this task you will activate MDM auto-enrollment for new devices in your Adatum Corporation tenant. The devices will belong to members of the WIP Users group that you created in Azure AD in the prior task. You will also configure Intune as your mobile device management authority. Activating MDM auto-enrollment is required so that you can implement Windows Information Protection in a later lab.

1. In **Microsoft Edge**, select a new tab and enter the following URL in the address bar: **https://portal.azure.com**.

2. On the **Welcome to Azure** page, select **Continue to Azure Portal website.**
